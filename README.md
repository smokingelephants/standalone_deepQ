# standalone_deepQ
DeepQ ported to python 2.7 as standalone package from openAI baselines(does not require python 3+)
This package allows executing the DeepQ Reinforcement Learning package found in openai baselines which only supports python 3.5+
This package curates the required files and makes changes which allow executing this in python 2.7

Please use the packages from https://github.com/openai/baselines if python 3.x is available
